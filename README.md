# 🧠 AI Python Debugger

A smart, beginner-friendly AI-based debugging tool built using Python and Tkinter. This tool simulates bug detection and correction by analyzing code errors and suggesting appropriate fixes in a clean, interactive GUI.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

The goal is to detect bugs in user-written Python code and provide intelligent suggestions for fixing them. This project demonstrates a rule-based AI approach to simulate how future ML-based debuggers might work.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- **Bug Detection:** Analyze code and categorize errors using Python's exception system.  
- **Fix Suggestion:** Recommend possible fixes based on error type and code context.  
- **Interactive GUI:** Provide a user-friendly interface for inputting, running, and debugging code.  
- **Heuristic-Based AI Logic:** Implement rule-based suggestions for common Python errors.  

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧾 **Code Editor**: Enter and run any Python code snippet.  
- 🛠️ **Error Detection**: Catch common errors like `SyntaxError`, `NameError`, `IndentationError`, and more.  
- 🤖 **Smart Fixer**: Generate intelligent suggestions for fixing bugs.  
- 🧪 **Output Console**: Display standard output or detailed error reports with fix suggestions.  
- 🎨 **Dark-Themed GUI**: Clean and modern Tkinter-based user interface.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x  
- **GUI Framework:** Tkinter  
- **Core Libraries:** `traceback`, `sys`, `io`

## 🧠 Future Enhancements

- ⚙️ Integrate machine learning models (CodeBERT, GPT, etc.) for intelligent bug detection.  
- 🌐 Web-based version using Flask or Django.  
- 💡 Syntax highlighting and intelligent autocomplete.  
- 🧩 Multi-language support (e.g., JavaScript, C++).
